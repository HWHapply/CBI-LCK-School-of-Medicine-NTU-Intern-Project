# Novel Algorithms for Predicting Mental Health Status from Clinical Test and Gene Expression Data

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence(AI) technologies has enabled efficient
and accurate early prediction of AD and dementia. The aim of this project is to develop
a novel pipeline to mine the significant features in clinical testing datasets and blood
cell gene expression datasets, and train AI models for predicting mental health status.
There are two main research directions. The first is developing a method based on a
hand-drawing task developed by CUHK counterparts, evaluating if performance can
be enhanced by combining it with clinical Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA)
tasks to determine which part is meaningful for mental health status prediction.
The other is the modeling of dementia using blood-based gene expression data from
ADNI and ANMerge. Developing a novel pipeline to remove the batch effect,
significant gene selection, and prediction modeling. This project can lead to new digital
health tools that can help in the early prediction of mental health and also cognitive
disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's.
